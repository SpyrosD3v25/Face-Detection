----------------------------HOW TO USE IT#
There is a faces folder. You have to put there the faces that your program will be able to recognize. 
This is done by putting ther pictures. 
Each Picture has to contain only one face.
The program will recognize those by the name you put to each photo. For Exapmle if you have a photo of George Hotz you have to write Gorge Hotz.(and here the extention). If you put, 123123132.jpeg lets say, when the program detects him as 123123132.
Put The photo in whick you have a face you want your program ot recognize in in the same folder with the program face_rec.py
